# Continuity

## Goal (incl. success criteria)
Implement the owner-approved encounter preprocessing split: reusable traditional
and GLP-1 data creation upstream, study analysis downstream, reference port preserved.

## Constraints/Assumptions
Preserve FULL_DATA and AFTER_EXCLUSION membership, timing, repeated encounters,
and measurement imputation. No propensity models upstream. Private outputs remain
external. Execute on the Mac mini without changing drive state.

## Key decisions
Reuse accepted transformations and canonical source projections. Publish two
encounter-grain Parquet products with evidence, dictionary, manifest and QA.
Move study analysis without claiming its known scientific defects are repaired.

## State
Implementation in isolated worktrees from verified merged source heads.

## Done
Implementation, 8 focused encounter checks, relocated GLP-1 fixtures, bounded
review, lint/format and layout checks complete. All 92 extracted legacy
function/class ASTs match their accepted originals. Reference port untouched.

## Now
Private build failed at encounter-context deduplication under the 2816-MiB
DuckDB cap; retained intermediates remain external. Both PRs have green CI at
their prior heads. A focused query-width/key-scope repair is being checked.
Early FULL_DATA membership comparison also failed; investigate source compatibility
before restarting expensive enrichment or merging.

## Next
Finish private output comparison, record aggregate evidence, merge upstream
first and then downstream after checks pass.

## Open questions
Canonical source validated: 837 catalog elements including 303 source concepts.
Canonical compatibility capture uses corrected_v1 and earliest_per_setting;
its encounter population differs from the retained accepted reference.
The source/input boundary needs reconciliation; no scientific acceptance claimed.

## Working set
Encounter builder and relocated GLP-1 modules; focused pytest, Ruff,
source/output comparison and normal repository checks.
